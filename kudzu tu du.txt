"do" syntax

debuggability
  special logic for checking format of:
    uniforms
    layout
    structs
    defines
    ins/outs
    precision
  for functions
    compile line by line, catch errors on individual lines, print failed line

new features once parity is reached:
  prefix statements
  inouts
  vector destructuring

rather than always keeping the first implementation when fn signatures conflict,
  if the implementations are exactly the same then just only emit one
  if the implementations aren't exactly the same, throw an error
